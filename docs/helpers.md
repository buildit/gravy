# Helpers

There are a few helper classes that can be used in your code to help outputting some particular functionality that is not provided elsewhere.

## State Helpers

These helper classes have names that usually define or modify a state, and they're prefixed with `has-` or `is-`.

- `.is-heading`: gives the possibility to use the heading `font-family` without having to use a specific element or heading class.
- `.is-secondary`: gives the possibility to use the secondary font without having to use a specific element.
- `.has-baseline-grid`: displays the baseline grid. Uses functionality provided by Typi.
