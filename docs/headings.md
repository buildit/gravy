# Headings

All the headings that HTML provides have been implemented. On top of that, some classes have been mapped against them. You can totally ignore them, but from a semantic point of view, they provide an easy way to have titles and subtitles.

Ideally you can have 3 levels of titles and subtitles, namely:

- `title-main` and `subtitle-main`,
- `title` and `subtitle`,
- `title-small` and `subtitle-small`.

There's no strict binding between these, so you can use any combination as needed, it's mostly a question of font size.

Give what has been said in [Typography and Vertical Rhythm](typography-and-vertical-rhythm.md), the headings, their font size and line height is using the `$typi` map. In other words:

- `title-main` with `alpha`,
- `subtitle-main` with `beta`,
- `title` with `gamma`,
- `subtitle` with `delta`,
- `title-small` with `eta`,
- `subtitle-small` with `text-big`
